response(request, server)

request will contain the http method, vars, args if post or delete

configFile will contain all the info about the requested server (locations|index|cgi...)

header = header that will be sent

body = body that will be sent

status = status code

request object from request class from constructor
server object from server class from constructor

all this methods logic will be depending on the request object and server :

char *GET() : requested file => read it and check if avail => status code => header => body => return char* response

char *POST() : get params from => check error codes => save the shit => return

char *DELETE() : check params =>check error codes => delete the shit => return
